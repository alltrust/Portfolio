## Who Am I?

The short and direct answer is: I am Aldo Garcia, a full-stack developer based out of Toronto, Ontario.

To add to that, I am passionate about using JavaScript frameworks to build modern, scalable, and aesthetic applications. I began programming a couple of years ago with the intention of quitting my old job as a teacher and pursuing something I found significantly more fulfilling. What was once a persistent thought has now become a current reality as I taught myself how not to smash my head on the keyboard, taking deep breaths whenever required.

My journey started with the ever-common web development route of HTML, CSS, and JS. Using these, I built a Yelp-like campground app (INSERT LINK HERE). As I progressed, I wanted to move away from using EJS and other engines to write dynamic HTML and began to familiarize myself with React and React frameworks. It was during this time that I created the inevitable yet infamous to-do app, along with a Job tracker application and an article scraper app using the MERN stack with TypeScript. Fast forward to my present portfolio, which I took advantage of the new Next.js release to create.

Outside of my programming life, I have always been very active in my community as a soccer coach, working with high-performance athletes and preparing them for scholarship pathways, both nationally and abroad.

In my spare time, when I'm not lifting, reading, coaching, or completing DIY projects, you'll find me driving across the GTA to meet with friends and family.
