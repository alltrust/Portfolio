## New phone who dis?


INT. ALDO 'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - EARLY MORNING  
Aldo's cell-phone rings. It's David Ornstein from The Athletic. He eating his farmer's breakfast wrap and answers.

###### ALDO
(proceeds to chew)  
-Hello ?

###### ORNSTEIN
-Ronaldo, is this you?... I'm writing a quick piece on you- may I please have 10 minutes of your time?

###### ALDO
-No- it's Aldo, wrong number mate.  
(... muffled noise from ornstein's - Aldo hears something about- "we still need to ask him some questions though")

###### ORNSTEIN
(sighs of disappointment)  
-Guess, we need some info from you as well- you got 2 minutes rather?

##### ALDO
(ego stricken)  
-Yea I guess so...

##### ORNSTEIN
-Great! Who are you and what do you do?

##### ALDO
-I'm a fullstack-developer, living in toronto Ontario. My goal is to...

##### ORNSTEIN
-Full-sta ... what? What is that?

##### ALDO
-Honestly, I barely know myself. But if I had to give you some short explanation i'd say its someone who can bridge that gap between building front end interfaces- what the users see and interact with-  and handle back end operation like storing your information and fetching you some data based on how you interact with the front end. 

##### ORNSTEIN
-Don't be modest- clearly you know something!

##### ALDO
(ego slowly recovering)  
-Well I guess you're right! Like I was saying before my goal is ...

##### ORNSTEIN
(immediately interrupts)  
-What did you do before you started this "full-stack development"?

##### ALDO
-I had a great job as a teacher and a coach. I still coach, however. 

##### ORNSTEIN
-Tell me more about that.

##### ALDO 
-I've been a soccer athlete most of my life- my whole family's played. Really enjoyed working in a team dynamic where everyone's working together to achieve the same goal- we worked hard day in and day out, we were critical of each other and we learned a lot from having high expectations of one another. This inspired me to become high-performance coach at a Toronto academy- where our aim is to put student athletes on a path to achieving scholarhsip opportunities. 

##### ORNSTEIN
-Sounds to me like you're a great teamplayer, who's constantly learning from your peers and your students. Guess I can say you're also open to feedback and criticism considering you're used to that competitive environment.
-Anything else you do besides footy and coding?

##### ALDO
-Actually yeah! I've always been interested in working out, reading both fiction and non-fiction, building DIY projects- stuff like that really.

##### ORNSTEIN
(snarky)  
-Ain't got any friends 'ave ya?

##### ALDO
(angrily)  
-WHAT!? I do! In fact I've got a few, we hang out on weekends and after work sometimes! One of them actually encouraged me into going into programming.

##### ORNSTEIN
(laughing)  
-Relax, it was only banter. And is that so? Why did you listen to him then, and how did you get started?

##### ALDO
(takes deep breath, calming down)  
-Initially, I taught myself how to not smash my head on the keyboard out of frustation and to take deep breaths whenever required. 
I then went the ever-popular web dev route with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Later picked up solid understanding of frameworks with React to build MERN stack apps with typescript- and now I've been working a lot with NEXT.js.

-I know I wanted a change in my life trajectory. I wanted to find something that would lead me to constantly growing and learning- that's why I took it seriously, because I craved problem-solving, like puzzles and legos- and to do this in a creative way is what makes it most enjoyable. 

##### ORNSTEIN
(sarcastically)  
-WOW! that's amazing! Ok, last thing, we need a quote from you- some words that really resonate with you. GO!

##### ALDO
(without hesitation - Finally puts down his breakfast wrap)  
-"You should be afraid of taking risks and pursuing something meaningful. But you should be more afraid of staying where you are."

##### ORNSTEIN 
-Philisophical are we? Where'd you get that?

##### ALDO
(fires back confindently)  
-I read about it, in a book about it. You don't read?  
(Aldo's mom calls from upstairs)

##### ALDO
-My bad I gotta go.

##### ORNSTEIN
(jokingly)  
-Mum's callin' eh?
Give 'er a kiss from me.

##### ALDO 
-WHAT?!

##### ORNSTEIN
-huh?  
(Ornstein immediately hang's up...)
